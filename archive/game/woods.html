		<p style="color: white">You stand in the middle of a clearing deep in the woods. The darkness of twilight surrounds you. You would fall asleep right there if you could--if it were safe. You are exhausted.</p>
		
		<p style="color: white">In the distance, you see a warm light. The source is a small wooden cabin. You think of safety and home, but before you take a step forward, a faint groan reaches your ears. The groan becomes louder.</p>
