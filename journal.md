Hello world! This is a small side-project where I keep notes on what I’m learning at the moment.

# 09/14/22
Today's lesson was on negative space and how that looks like in web layouts or mood boards (those were the main examples but the concepts are very universal).

- Have a design system--once you establish why you like what you like, it'll need to be reproduced in the future. "I like it just because," isn't modular / scalable
- Negative space is in-between, around, inside, etc. What isn't occupied at the moment depending on how you look at it.
- Playing with contrast or juxtaposing different objects together can really change the look and feel of what you see. Colors, shapes, sizes, proximity, etc.
- Ask "what if" often when exploring how a layout or design looks. There's an early testing phase where you're trying to find what "feels right" and then decide why. Asking "what if I do this?" and then doing it speeds up the discovery process.
- Also, understanding why you're arranging objects that way / making that design choice will come in handy when selling your idea to the client or team.
- Weight (border thickness, object size) can really draw the eye, can be used strategically

Questions / Comments:
- What sizes should I use in Affinity Designer to mimic mobile, tablet, and screen displays? I waant to be precise.
- Unrelated but for my icon challenge, I should find out sizes icons are normally at
- My skills don't match my vision yet. I want to be able to template / layout build faster and more accurately with Affinity Designer. Then actually code it!

## Standup:

Yesterday,
- Took some notes during the lesson videos
- Thought about what the exercises could be like
- Played around with space in my mood board
- Digitized one of the layouts I sketched with - Affinity Designer to explore white space and alignment
- Upload the journal notes and share my ideas about the process
- Do a quick thing-a-day
Share visual inspo.

Today,
- The dailies:
	- Shared visual inspo.
	- Writing notes on Milka and Chris’ critiques
	- Drawing a new icon
	- Practicing the Drawabox lesson
	- Setting up DeployBot :robot_face:
	- Digitize another one of my layouts to AD so I can compare ideas for the personal website
	- Check-in on StackOverflow to see if there are any questions to ask / answer
	- Work on a blog post draft in my Substack

Today's Lesson:
We took a deep dive into typography and specifically into rules for contrast and space

Chris Do's rules
1. Flush left (more natural)
2. Use one type face--it's hard to know if you're using two successfully
3. Skip a font weight for contrast
4. Double point size, and sometimes triple or quadruple for dramatic effect
5. Align everything to one axis
6. Use any typeface you like as long is it's one he recommends, haha (my favorite is in there--Baskerville!)
7. Group objects by using rules or lines
8. Avoid the corners--negative space is good, so don't put things on the edge or corner unless it's to cut the object off
9. Careful with the spacing at the end and beginning of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Avoid creating accidental shapes (rag).

- Limiting parameters is great because you consider other elements like negative space
- Hierarchy means what do you read first, second, third
	- Mass (large, medium small)
	- Bold, regular, light
	- Many, few 
	- Tall, short
- Avoid using many tricks. The eyes get lost.
- Avoid slanted or "off-grid" layouts with text, so diagonal
- Space can be measure: small, medium, large
- Watch out for leding, when letters touch each other
- Sometimes having things be the same is boring
- Dead space is space that doesn't have a reason, no breathing, contrast, etc. 
- Do not stretch the type!
- What if? What if? Ask it all the time when creating.
- Rythm comes with interaction between objects
- Confusion can come up when there's no main focal point or a reason behind decisions. Putting a couple of "cool things" together doesn't always work.
- When you rotate the axist of text (like making text that would normally be horizontal into a vertical line) you can accidentally create visual barriers
- Do many many versions
- Chris Do also says that with logo design there's too many tricks! Why is that bad? Too many tricks MAKE THINGS AGE BAD. You age well with simplicity.

I'm back after a surviving my second hurricane! I caught up fast after doing four or so lessons in one day, pretty surprised.

## Standup

Today,
√ Finished each day’s TAD icon
√ Re-created an e-commerce store site
√ Created a quick style tile for my personal site
√ Made a simple postcard in AD
√ Created a black and white graphic representing a word that had to be guessed
√ Finally, created another style tile that is e-commerce focused (for an audiphile store)


### Notes:
- When designing for yourself, it helps to image that you are the client. The distance makes it easier to think about your goals and ways to present them visually before building a prototype.
- We all absorb visual information in different ways. Sometimes and abstract or practical poster says a completely different message than we intended. So it's important to ask people what colors, words, textures, layouts, and design in general feels like. Ask them to describe it as best they can.
- What an interesting exercise… I ended up with two styles that are completely different than what I aimed for.
- I love simplicity. I start with crazy visuals in my head but always end up doing something minimal.
- Lot's of colors have their place, but black and white goes a long way. It's important to makes sure that "visual tricks" are not there just to paint over a boring canvas.
- I like focusing on text rather than images--so that’s why I enjoy using little tricks like text gradients to type pop
