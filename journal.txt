Hello world! This is a small side-project where I keep notes on what Iâ€™m learning at the moment.

Today's lesson was on negative space and how that looks like in web layouts or mood boards (those were the main examples but the concepts are very universal).

- Have a design system--once you establish why you like what you like, it'll need to be reproduced in the future. "I like it just because," isn't modular / scalable
- Negative space is in-between, around, inside, etc. What isn't occupied at the moment depending on how you look at it.
- Playing with contrast or juxtaposing different objects together can really change the look and feel of what you see. Colors, shapes, sizes, proximity, etc.
- Ask "what if" often when exploring how a layout or design looks. There's an early testing phase where you're trying to find what "feels right" and then decide why. Asking "what if I do this?" and then doing it speeds up the discovery process.
- Also, understanding why you're arranging objects that way / making that design choice will come in handy when selling your idea to the client or team.
- Weight (border thickness, object size) can really draw the eye, can be used strategically



Questions / Comments:
- What sizes should I use in Affinity Designer to mimic mobile, tablet, and screen displays? I waant to be precise.
- Unrelated but for my icon challenge, I should find out sizes icons are normally at
- My skills don't match my vision yet. I want to be able to template / layout build faster and more accurately with Affinity Designer. Then actually code it!
