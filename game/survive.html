		<p style="color: white">The bears run after the pies (turns out the box they were scratching on was a pot of honey--poor things) and leave the cabin. You close the door behind them and let out a sigh of relief.</p>

		<p style="color: white">Turns out that even in a cursed wood with a lone cabin and mysterious creatures, you can always perform a random act of kindness 🐻❤️🥧</p>

		<h2 style="color: red">You survived!</h1>
