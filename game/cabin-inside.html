		<p style="color: white">You crouch and sneak closer to the window. After you hoist yourself up, you see a large bear... and two smaller bears beside. They are all scratching on what seems to be a large box. You could turn around--but the creatures of this cursed forest might be worse than the bears.</p>

		<p style="color: white">You succesfully climb over the window. On the floor, there are pans of pie strewn all across the kitchen. "Poor bears, they just wanted some apple pie," you think to yourself. Your heart fills with love.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="survive.html" style="color: red">Pick up the pies and throw them out the window to simultaneously save yourself and feed the bears</a></li>
			<li><a href="dead.html" style="color: red">Reject your newfound love of stray bears and pick up a bread knife then "rawr!" menacingly at them</a></li>
